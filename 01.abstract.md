## Abstract {.page_break_before}
Let us try to generalize the dynamics of the hydrogen molecule at a fixed center of mass clamped between two point-like        
STM tips [@url:https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11619] to the case of unrestricted center of mass motion between those tips.          
The three additional                                                                                                            
degrees of freedom should increase the length of a QMC run by a factor 3 to obtain a similar variance provided an approximate  
linear scaling is obeyed. Here, we investigate tips of equal negative charge. From the electrostatic point of view the tips    
yield for a neutral polarizable object as H2 a rather flat potential trough halfway betwen the tips. Much more pronounced, 
the quantum mechnical calculation shows for the center of mass probability distribution an extremely flat minimum along the 
tip-tip direction which contrasts with a steep lateral potential curvature. An experimental realization should reflect this 
behavior in the vibration modes of the center of mass.     

The actual numerical problem lies in the necessity of extremely long runs compared to those with fixed center of mass. The 
statistical reliability of the Monte-Carlo scheme suffers from a variable step width that extremely depends on the steepness 
of the lateral slope in contrast to the flatness of the longitudinal slope of the wave function for a correct sampling of the  
distribution. A failure in the sampling shows in decreasing step acceptance rates occurring together with a loss of 
kinetic energy and a misleading gain of potential energy close to the tips, i.e. at the classical centers of attraction.
